You’ll be able to send them items, earn bonuses—and even trade Pokémon! The four levels of Friendships along with with their bonuses are listed below. It is strongly encouraged to raise Friendship levels with your local players quickly, as these bonuses work on top of the existing Weather and Team based damage / ball bonuses. However, only the highest friend bonus is applied – they do not stack up.")
